Getting Started
---------------

To get started with AMBIENT ROM, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the ParanoidAndroid trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Zest-Dev/android.git -b jb4.3

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -f -c -j32
